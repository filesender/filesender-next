# FileSender Next

FileSender Next is a fresh rewrite of the widely-used FileSender application, now implemented in Go.

## Why a Rewrite?

During the last FileSender meeting at the TNC24 conference, it was concluded that working towards a more secure FileSender codebase should be the priority for the roadmap. After more than 12 years of development, the original FileSender 2.x codebase has grown in complexity.

This rewrite aims to:

- Improve security
- Simplify the architecture
- Enable new features, including end-to-end encryption for large files

For more information, see the [official update from FileSender](https://filesender.org/filesender-online-infoshare-update-on-release-3-0-and-security-approach/).

## Current Status

This repository represents the initial stage of the rewrite effort, aiming to deliver an MVP that captures the core FileSender functionality with improved security and simplicity.

## Repositories

- Primary development occurs on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/filesender/filesender-next).
- Mirrored repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/filesender/filesender-next).
