# FileSender Next

FileSender Next is a fresh rewrite of the widely-used FileSender platform, now implemented in Go.

## Why a Rewrite?

After more than 15 years of active development, the original FileSender codebase has grown complex and difficult to maintain. Recent security audits have highlighted vulnerabilities, making it clear that enhancing security and maintainability is essential. This rewrite aims to:

- Significantly improve security
- Simplify the architecture
- Enable new features, including end-to-end encryption for large files

For more information, see the [official update from FileSender](https://filesender.org/filesender-online-infoshare-update-on-release-3-0-and-security-approach/).

## Current Status

This repository represents the initial stage of the rewrite effort, aiming to deliver an MVP that captures the core FileSender functionality with improved security and simplicity.

## Repositories

- Primary development occurs on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/filesender/filesender-next).
- Mirrored repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/filesender/filesender-next).
